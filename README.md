### Hello there! âœ¨

I primarily work on projects in the embedded hardware/software and digital design space. Outside of `$DAYJOB`, virtually everything I do is here and open-source.

Here's the repos where I store personal projects. Not organized for collaboration, but rather meant as a starting point for anyone wanting to do something similar.
- [zephyrboards](https://github.com/dragonlock2/zephyrboards)
- [miscboards](https://github.com/dragonlock2/miscboards)
- [kicadboards](https://github.com/dragonlock2/kicadboards)
- [extraparts](https://github.com/dragonlock2/extraparts)
- [matthewtran.com](https://github.com/dragonlock2/matthewtran.com)
- [dragonlock2.github.io](https://github.com/dragonlock2/dragonlock2.github.io)

These projects were intended for direct use by others. Open to collaboration!
- [autodbconv](https://github.com/dragonlock2/autodbconv)
- [JABI](https://github.com/dragonlock2/JABI)
- [OSRO](https://github.com/dragonlock2/OSRO)
